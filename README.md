# taskTracker
Simple task list
Description of project:
The project was directed to be a task list of at least two pages (max 25 items/page) items complete were to be identified in gray text
on the list. Items identified as partially complete were to be grayed out and copied to the bottom of the list. 

management Technique:
My task management technique was a whiteboard drawn Kanban board (To-Do, Doing, Done). Post-its were used for the tasks. 
My time usage was under-estimated. I expected to have the user interface and basic methods complete in the first day, 
but I really didn't gain any traction on the project until day three(Wed). This was after struggling with methods and starting over
multiple times. The User interface and all basic methods were estimated to take an hour each. Overall, my estimations were low and I 
did not complete the basic objectives of the project. 

If given More time: 
I would focus on completing the basic requirements of the project. I am currently not able to scroll between pages or shift tasks to 
the bottom of the list. If given more time 24-48 hours, I am confident I can accomplish the last two requirements.
